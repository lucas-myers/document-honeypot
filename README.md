# document-honeypot
This project implements a document-based honeypot designed to detect and monitor unauthorized access attempts on decoy files within a controlled environment. The honeypot simulates sensitive corporate documents (e.g., “payroll_2025.xlsx”) and captures activity logs when these files are accessed or modified.
