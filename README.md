# document-honeypot
This project implements a document-based honeypot designed to detect and monitor unauthorized access attempts on decoy files within a controlled environment(I used a VM of Ubuntu). The honeypot simulates sensitive corporate documents (e.g., “payroll_2025.xlsx”) and captures activity logs when these files are accessed or modified.

⚙️ Features

Automated deployment using Terraform and Ansible

Decoy files (e.g., payroll_2025.xlsx) hosted with Nginx to attract unauthorized access

Filebeat sends logs to Elasticsearch for indexing and analysis

Kibana dashboards visualize intrusion events and source IPs in real time

Purpose

This honeypot demonstrates how intrusion attempts can be safely observed and analyzed using automated tools and centralized logging systems.
It helps visualize attack patterns, source IPs, and access behavior for cybersecurity research and education.
